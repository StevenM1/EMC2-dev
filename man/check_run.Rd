\title{Runs a series of convergence checks, printing statistics to the console and
saving plots to a pdf. Note that the R_hat (psrf and mpsrf, i.e., gelman_diag
from the coda package) is calculated by doubling the number of chains by
first splitting chains into first and second half so it also a test of
stationarity. Efficiency of sampling is indicated by integrated autocorrelation
time (from the LaplacesDemon package) and the effective numebr of samples
(from coda).}

\arguments{
\item{samples}{A list of samplers or samplers converted to mcmc objects.}

\item{pdf_name}{The name of the plot save file}

\item{interactive}{Pause console output between hierarchical parameter types}

\item{filter}{Sampling stage to examine.}

\item{subfilter}{An integer or vector. If integer it will exclude up until
that integer. If vector it will include everything in that range.}

\item{thin}{An integer. Keep only iterations that are a multiple of thin.}

\item{layout}{A vector specifying the layout as in par(mfrow = layout).
If NA (defualt) use CODA defaults, if NULL use current.}

\item{width}{PDF page width}

\item{height}{PDF page height}
